# Advanced Usage - Switch Between D-Pad and Joystick

This is an example demonstrating how to combine multiple skins together and switch between different layouts with a switch button.
In this example, both D-Pad and Joystick versions of skins are combined to support real-time switching.

Please refer to `retrodelta.json` for the detailed setup.

**Note:**
- Switched skins should have the same screen position and size
- To ensure the Joystick works as D-Pad properly, make sure to set Quick Menu => Controls => Port 1 => Analog to Digital Type => Left Analog
