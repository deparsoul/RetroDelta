# Advanced Usage - Switch Between Filtered and Non-Filtered

This is an example demonstrating how to combine multiple skins together and switch between different layouts with a switch button.
In this example, skins with and without screen filter are combined to support real-time switching.

Please refer to `retrodelta.json` for the detailed setup.

**Note:**
- Switched skins should have the same screen position and size
- Different positions can be specified in `switchButton` for portrait and landscape orientations
